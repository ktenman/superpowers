# Resuming From an Existing Ledger

Part of superpowers:subagent-driven-development. This plan's workspace
already has a ledger at `<workspace>/progress.md`.

If the ledger's first line names your plan file, tasks with a `Task <N>:
complete` line are DONE — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first
task without one. A task whose last line is a simplify or fix round is
mid-task and its implementation is already committed: resume at the next
step, never at the implementer. A ledger whose first line names a
different plan file — or a stray ledger at the old flat path
`.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — is another plan's progress: leave it in
place and start your own, fresh.
